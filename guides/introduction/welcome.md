# Welcome

Welcome to Phoenix LiveView documentation. Phoenix LiveView enables
rich, real-time user experiences with server-rendered HTML. A general
overview of LiveView and its benefits is [available in our README](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view).

## What is a LiveView?

LiveViews are processes that receive events, update their state,
and render updates to a page as diffs.

The LiveView programming model is declarative: instead of saying
"once event X happens, change Y on the page", events in LiveView
are regular messages which may cause changes to the state. Once
the state changes, the LiveView will re-render the relevant parts of
its HTML template and push it to the browser, which updates the page
in the most efficient manner.

LiveView state is nothing more than functional and immutable
Elixir data structures. The events are either internal application messages
(usually emitted by `Phoenix.PubSub`) or sent by the client/browser.

Every LiveView is first rendered statically as part of a regular
HTTP request, which provides quick times for "First Meaningful
Paint", in addition to helping search and indexing engines.
A persistent connection is then established between the client and
server. This allows LiveView applications to react faster to user
events as there is less work to be done and less data to be sent
compared to stateless requests that have to authenticate, decode, load,
and encode data on every request.

## Example

LiveView is included by default in Phoenix applications.
Therefore, to use LiveView, you must have already installed Phoenix
and created your first application. If you haven't done so,
check [Phoenix' installation guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html)
to get started.

The behaviour of a LiveView is outlined by a module which implements
a series of functions as callbacks. Let's see an example. Write the
file below to `lib/my_app_web/live/thermostat_live.ex`:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.ThermostatLive do
  use MyAppWeb, :live_view

  def render(assigns) do
    ~H"""
    Current temperature: {@temperature}°F
    <button phx-click="inc_temperature">+</button>
    """
  end

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    temperature = 70 # Let's assume a fixed temperature for now
    {:ok, assign(socket, :temperature, temperature)}
  end

  def handle_event("inc_temperature", _params, socket) do
    {:noreply, update(socket, :temperature, &(&1 + 1))}
  end
end
```

The module above defines three functions (they are callbacks
required by LiveView). The first one is `render/1`,
which receives the socket `assigns` and is responsible for returning
the content to be rendered on the page. We use the `~H` sigil to define
a HEEx template, which stands for HTML+EEx. They are an extension of
Elixir's builtin EEx templates, with support for HTML validation, syntax-based
components, smart change tracking, and more. You can learn more about
the template syntax in `Phoenix.Component.sigil_H/2` (note
`Phoenix.Component` is automatically imported when you use `Phoenix.LiveView`).

The data used on rendering comes from the `mount` callback. The
`mount` callback is invoked when the LiveView starts. In it, you
can access the request parameters, read information stored in the
session (typically information which identifies who is the current
user), and a socket. The socket is where we keep all state, including
assigns. `mount` proceeds to assign a default temperature to the socket.
Because Elixir data structures are immutable, LiveView APIs often
receive the socket and return an updated socket. Then we return
`{:ok, socket}` to signal that we were able to mount the LiveView
successfully. After `mount`, LiveView will render the page with the
values from `assigns` and send it to the client.

If you look at the HTML rendered, you will notice there is a button
with a `phx-click` attribute. When the button is clicked, a
`"inc_temperature"` event is sent to the server, which is matched and
handled by the `handle_event` callback. This callback updates the socket
and returns `{:noreply, socket}` with the updated socket.
`handle_*` callbacks in LiveView (and in Elixir in general) are
invoked based on some action, in this case, the user clicking a button.
The `{:noreply, socket}` return means there is no additional replies
sent to the browser, only that a new version of the page is rendered.
LiveView then computes diffs and sends them to the client.

Now we are ready to render our LiveView. You can serve the LiveView
directly from your router:

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.Router do
  use MyAppWeb, :router

  pipeline :browser do
    ...
  end

  scope "/", MyAppWeb do
    pipe_through :browser
    ...

    live "/thermostat", ThermostatLive
  end
end
```

Once the LiveView is rendered, a regular HTML response is sent. In your
app.js file, you should find the following:

```javascript
import {Socket} from "phoenix"
import {LiveSocket} from "phoenix_live_view"

let csrfToken = document.querySelector("meta[name='csrf-token']").getAttribute("content")
let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {params: {_csrf_token: csrfToken}})
liveSocket.connect()
```

Now the JavaScript client will connect over WebSockets and `mount/3` will be invoked
inside a spawned LiveView process.

## Parameters and session

The mount callback receives three arguments: the request parameters, the session, and the socket.

The parameters can be used to read information from the URL. For example, assuming you have a `Thermostat` module defined somewhere that can read this information based on the house name, you could write this:

```elixir
def mount(%{"house" => house}, _session, socket) do
  temperature = Thermostat.get_house_reading(house)
  {:ok, assign(socket, :temperature, temperature)}
end
```

And then in your router:

```elixir
live "/thermostat/:house", ThermostatLive
```

The session retrieves information from a signed (or encrypted) cookie. This is where you can store authentication information, such as `current_user_id`:

```elixir
def mount(_params, %{"current_user_id" => user_id}, socket) do
  temperature = Thermostat.get_user_reading(user_id)
  {:ok, assign(socket, :temperature, temperature)}
end
```

> Phoenix comes with built-in authentication generators. See `mix phx.gen.auth`.

Most times, in practice, you will use both:

```elixir
def mount(%{"house" => house}, %{"current_user_id" => user_id}, socket) do
  temperature = Thermostat.get_house_reading(user_id, house)
  {:ok, assign(socket, :temperature, temperature)}
end
```

In other words, you want to read the information about a given house, as long as the user has access to it.

## Bindings

Phoenix supports DOM element bindings for client-server interaction. For
example, to react to a click on a button, you would render the element:

```heex
<button phx-click="inc_temperature">+</button>
```

Then on the server, all LiveView bindings are handled with the `handle_event/3`
callback, for example:

    def handle_event("inc_temperature", _value, socket) do
      {:noreply, update(socket, :temperature, &(&1 + 1))}
    end

To update UI state, for example, to open and close dropdowns, switch tabs,
etc, LiveView also supports JS commands (`Phoenix.LiveView.JS`), which
execute directly on the client without reaching the server. To learn more,
see [our bindings page](bindings.md) for a complete list of all LiveView
bindings as well as our [JavaScript interoperability guide](js-interop.md).

LiveView has built-in support for forms, including uploads and association
management. See `Phoenix.Component.form/1` as a starting point and
`Phoenix.Component.inputs_for/1` for working with associations.
The [Uploads](uploads.md) and [Form bindings](form-bindings.md) guides provide
more information about advanced features.

## Navigation

LiveView provides functionality to allow page navigation using the
[browser's pushState API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History_API).
With live navigation, the page is updated without a full page reload.

You can either *patch* the current LiveView, updating its URL, or
*navigate* to a new LiveView. You can learn more about them in the
[Live Navigation](live-navigation.md) guide.

## Generators

Phoenix v1.6 and later includes code generators for LiveView. If you want to see
an example of how to structure your application, from the database all the way up
to LiveViews, run the following:

```shell
$ mix phx.gen.live Blog Post posts title:string body:text
```

For more information, run `mix help phx.gen.live`.

For authentication, with built-in LiveView support, run `mix phx.gen.auth Account User users`.

## Compartmentalize state, markup, and events in LiveView

LiveView supports two extension mechanisms: function components, provided by
`HEEx` templates, and stateful components, known as LiveComponents.

### Function components to organize markup and event handling

Similar to `render(assigns)` in our LiveView, a function component is any
function that receives an assigns map and returns a `~H` template. For example:

    def weather_greeting(assigns) do
      ~H"""
      <div title="My div" class={@class}>
        <p>Hello {@name}</p>
        <MyApp.Weather.city name="Kraków"/>
      </div>
      """
    end

You can learn more about function components in the `Phoenix.Component`
module. At the end of the day, they are a useful mechanism for code organization
and to reuse markup in your LiveViews.

Sometimes you need to share more than just markup across LiveViews. When you also
want to move events to a separate module, or use the same event handler in multiple
places, function components can be paired with
[`Phoenix.LiveView.attach_hook/4`](`Phoenix.LiveView.attach_hook/4#sharing-event-handling-logic`).

### Live components to encapsulate additional state

A component will occasionally need control over not only its own events,
but also its own separate state. For these cases, LiveView
provides `Phoenix.LiveComponent`, which are rendered using
[`live_component/1`](`Phoenix.Component.live_component/1`):

```heex
<.live_component module={UserComponent} id={user.id} user={user} />
```

LiveComponents have their own `mount/1` and `handle_event/3` callbacks, as well
as their own state with change tracking support, similar to LiveViews. They are
lightweight since they "run" in the same process as the parent LiveView, but
are more complex than function components themselves. Given they all run in the
same process, errors in components cause the whole view to fail to render.
For a complete rundown, see `Phoenix.LiveComponent`.

When in doubt over [Functional components or live components?](`Phoenix.LiveComponent#functional-components-or-live-components`), default to the former.
Rely on the latter only when you need the additional state.

### live_render/3 to encapsulate state (with error isolation)

Finally, if you want complete isolation between parts of a LiveView, you can
always render a LiveView inside another LiveView by calling
[`live_render/3`](`Phoenix.Component.live_render/3`). This child LiveView
runs in a separate process than the parent, with its own callbacks. If a child
LiveView crashes, it won't affect the parent. If the parent crashes, all children
are terminated.

When rendering a child LiveView, the `:id` option is required to uniquely
identify the child. A child LiveView will only ever be rendered and mounted
a single time, provided its ID remains unchanged. To force a child to re-mount
with new session data, a new ID must be provided.

Given that it runs in its own process, a nested LiveView is an excellent tool
for creating completely isolated UI elements, but it is a slightly expensive
abstraction if all you want is to compartmentalize markup or events (or both).

### Summary
  * use `Phoenix.Component` for code organization and reusing markup (optionally with [`attach_hook/4`](`Phoenix.LiveView.attach_hook/4#sharing-event-handling-logic`) for event handling reuse)
  * use `Phoenix.LiveComponent` for sharing state, markup, and events between LiveViews
  * use nested `Phoenix.LiveView` to compartmentalize state, markup, and events (with error isolation)
