# Live layouts

Your LiveView applications can be made of two layouts:

  * the root layout - this layout typically contains the `<html>`
    definition alongside the head and body tags. Any content defined
    in the root layout will remain the same, even as you live navigate
    across LiveViews. The root layout is typically declared on the
    router with `put_root_layout` and defined as "root.html.heex"
    in your layouts folder. It calls `{@inner_content}` to inject the
    content rendered by the layout

  * the app layout - this is the dynamic layout part of your application,
    it often includes the menu, sidebar, flash messages, and more.
    From Phoenix v1.8, this layout is explicitly rendered in your templates
    by calling the `<Layouts.app />` component. In Phoenix v1.7 and earlier,
    the layout was typically configured as part of the `lib/my_app_web.ex`
    file, such as `use Phoenix.LiveView, layout: ...`

Overall, those layouts are found in `components/layouts` and are
embedded within `MyAppWeb.Layouts`.

## Root layout

The "root" layout is rendered only on the initial request and
therefore it has access to the `@conn` assign. The root layout
is typically defined in your router:

    plug :put_root_layout, html: {MyAppWeb.Layouts, :root}

The root layout can also be set via the `:root_layout` option
in your router via `Phoenix.LiveView.Router.live_session/2`.

## Updating document title

Because the root layout from the Plug pipeline is rendered outside of
LiveView, the contents cannot be dynamically changed. The one exception
is the `<title>` of the HTML document. Phoenix LiveView special cases
the `@page_title` assign to allow dynamically updating the title of the
page, which is useful when using live navigation, or annotating the browser
tab with a notification. For example, to update the user's notification
count in the browser's title bar, first set the `page_title` assign on
mount:

    def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
      socket = assign(socket, page_title: "Latest Posts")
      {:ok, socket}
    end

Then access `@page_title` in the root layout:

```heex
<title>{@page_title}</title>
```

You can also use the `Phoenix.Component.live_title/1` component to support
adding automatic prefix and suffix to the page title when rendered and
on subsequent updates:

```heex
<Phoenix.Component.live_title default="Welcome" prefix="MyApp â€“ ">
  {assigns[:page_title]}
</Phoenix.Component.live_title>
```

Although the root layout is not updated by LiveView, by simply assigning
to `page_title`, LiveView knows you want the title to be updated:

    def handle_info({:new_messages, count}, socket) do
      {:noreply, assign(socket, page_title: "Latest Posts (#{count} new)")}
    end

*Note*: If you find yourself needing to dynamically patch other parts of the
base layout, such as injecting new scripts or styles into the `<head>` during
live navigation, *then a regular, non-live, page navigation should be used
instead*. Assigning the `@page_title` updates the `document.title` directly,
and therefore cannot be used to update any other part of the base layout.
