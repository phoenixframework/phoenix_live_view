# Changelog

## Backwards incompatible changes for 1.0

LiveView 1.0 removes the client-based `phx-feedback-for` annotation for showing and hiding input feedback, such as validation errors. This has been replaced by `Phoenix.Component.used_input?/2`, which handles showing and hiding feedback using standard server rendering.

A backwards-compatible shim can be used to maintain `phx-feedback-for` in your existing applications:

1. Save the [`phx_feedback_dom.js` shim](https://gist.github.com/chrismccord/c4c60328c6ac5ec29e167bb115315d82) to your local `assets/js/phx_feedback_dom.js`.
2. Import it into your `assets/js/app.js`.
3. Add a new `dom` option to your `LiveSocket` constructor, or wrap the existing value:

```javascript
import {Socket} from "phoenix";
import {LiveSocket} from "phoenix_live_view"
import phxFeedbackDom from "./phx_feedback_dom"

let csrfToken = document.querySelector("meta[name='csrf-token']").getAttribute("content");
let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {
  params: {_csrf_token: csrfToken},
  dom: phxFeedbackDom({})
})
```

Additionally, the `phx-page-loading` attrbute has been removed in favor of using the `page_loading: true`
option to `Phoenix.LiveView.JS.push/2` as needed.

### Migrating from phx-feedback-for

While we provide [a shim for existing applications](https://gist.github.com/chrismccord/c4c60328c6ac5ec29e167bb115315d82) relying on phx-feedback-for,
you might want to migrate to the new approach.

The following guides you through the necessary changes assuming a project generated
with a recent (Phoenix 1.7), but pre LiveView 1.0 version of the phx generators.
For more general use cases, please also have a look at the documentation for [`used_input?/1`](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/1.0.0-rc.0/Phoenix.Component.html#used_input?/1).

First, ensure that you are using the latest versions of `:phoenix_ecto` and `:phoenix_html`. At the time of writing:

```elixir
{:phoenix_ecto, "~> 4.5"},
{:phoenix_html, "~> 4.1"},
```

#### Core components

1. Adjust the core components to omit the `phx-feedback-for` attribute and the `phx-no-feedback` classes.
This shows one example for the textarea input, but there are more cases that need to be adjusted accordingly:

```diff
   def input(%{type: "textarea"} = assigns) do
     ~H"""
-    <div phx-feedback-for={@name}>
+    <div>
       <.label for={@id}><%%= @label %></.label>
       <textarea
         id={@id}
         name={@name}
         class={[
-          "mt-2 block w-full rounded-lg text-zinc-900 focus:ring-0 sm:text-sm sm:leading-6",
-          "min-h-[6rem] phx-no-feedback:border-zinc-300 phx-no-feedback:focus:border-zinc-400",
+          "mt-2 block w-full rounded-lg text-zinc-900 focus:ring-0 sm:text-sm sm:leading-6 min-h-[6rem]",
           @errors == [] && "border-zinc-300 focus:border-zinc-400",
           @errors != [] && "border-rose-400 focus:border-rose-400"
         ]}
```
The following regex could be used to find and replace the relevant `phx-no-feedback` classes: `/phx-no-feedback:[\w\-\d:]+/`.

2. Filter the errors in the initial function for `Phoenix.HTML.FormField`s:

```diff
   def input(%{field: %Phoenix.HTML.FormField{} = field} = assigns) do
+    errors = if Phoenix.Component.used_input?(field), do: field.errors, else: []

     assigns
     |> assign(field: nil, id: assigns.id || field.id)
-    |> assign(:errors, Enum.map(field.errors, &translate_error(&1)))
+    |> assign(:errors, Enum.map(errors, &translate_error(&1)))
     |> assign_new(:name, fn -> if assigns.multiple, do: field.name <> "[]", else: field.name end)
     |> assign_new(:value, fn -> field.value end)
     |> input()
   end
```

3. You can remove the phx-no-feedback tailwind variant helper from your `tailwind.config.js`:

```diff
    //
-   plugin(({addVariant}) => addVariant("phx-no-feedback", [".phx-no-feedback&", ".phx-no-feedback &"])),
    plugin(({addVariant}) => addVariant("phx-click-loading", [".phx-click-loading&", ".phx-click-loading &"])),
```

#### phx.gen.auth

The settings page generated by phx.gen.auth creates a form to change the user's email as well as the password.
Because of the way the current password is checked in previous variants of the code, the error message for an invalid
password is not visible when migrating to `used_input?`. To make this work, two changes need to be made to the
generated user module:

1. add a new virtual field `:current_password` to the schema:

```diff
    field :hashed_password, :string, redact: true
+   field :current_password, :string, virtual: true, redact: true
```

2. cast the `current_password` field in the `validate_current_password` function:

```diff
   def validate_current_password(changeset, password) do
+    changeset = cast(changeset, %{current_password: password}, [:current_password])
+
     if valid_password?(changeset.data, password) do
```

## 0.18.0 (2022-09-20)

LiveView v0.18 includes a major new feature in the form of declarative assigns with new `attr`
and `slot` APIs for specifying which attributes a function component supports, the type,
and default values. Attributes and slots are compile-time verified and emit warnings (requires Elixir v1.14.0+).

v0.18 includes a number of new function components which replace their EEx expression
counterparts `<%= ... %>`. For example, `live_redirect`, `live_patch`, and Phoenix.HTML's
`link` have been replaced by a unified `Phoenix.Component.link/1` function component:

    <.link href="https://myapp.com">my app</.link>
    <.link navigate={@path}>remount</.link>
    <.link patch={@path}>patch</.link>

Those new components live in the `Phoenix.Component` module. `Phoenix.LiveView.Helpers`
itself has been soft deprecated and all relevant functionality has been migrated.
You must `import Phoenix.Component` where you previously imported `Phoenix.LiveView.Helpers`
when upgrading. You may also need to `import Phoenix.Component` where you also imported `Phoenix.LiveView` and some of its functions have been moved to `Phoenix.Component`.

Additionally, the special `let` attribute on function components have been deprecated by
a `:let` usage.

### Deprecations
  - `live_redirect` - deprecate in favor of new `<.link navigate={..}>` component of `Phoenix.Component`
  - `live_patch` - deprecate in favor of new `<.link patch={..}>` component of `Phoenix.Component`
  - `push_redirect` - deprecate in favor of new `push_navigate` function on `Phoenix.LiveView`

### Enhancements
  - [Component] Add declarative assigns with compile-time verifications and warnings via `attr`/`slot`
  - [Component] Add new attrs `:let` and `:for`, and `:if` with HTML tag, function component, and slot support. We still support `let` but the formatter will convert it to `:let` and soon it will be deprecated.

  - Add `sticky: true` option to `live_render` to maintain a nested child on across live redirects
  - Dispatch `phx:show-start`, `phx:show-end`, `phx:hide-start` and `phx:hide-end` on `JS.show|hide|toggle`
  - Add `get_connect_info/2` that also works on disconnected render
  - Add `LiveSocket` constructor options for configuration failsafe behavior via new `maxReloads`, `reloadJitterMin`, `reloadJitterMax`, `failsafeJitter` options

### Breaking Changes

#### `on_mount` changes

The hook API introduced in LiveView 0.16 has been improved based on feedback.
LiveView 0.17 removes the custom module-function callbacks for the
`Phoenix.LiveView.on_mount/1` macro and the `:on_mount` option for
`Phoenix.LiveView.Router.live_session/3` in favor of supporting a custom
argument. For clarity, the module function to be invoked during the mount
lifecycle stage will always be named `on_mount/4`.

For example, if you had invoked `on_mount/1` like so:

```elixir
on_mount MyAppWeb.MyHook
on_mount {MyAppWeb.MyHook, :assign_current_user}
```

and defined your callbacks as:

```elixir
# my_hook.ex

def mount(_params, _session, _socket) do
end

def assign_current_user(_params, _session, _socket) do
end
```

Change the callback to:

```elixir
# my_hook.ex

def on_mount(:default, _params, _session, _socket) do
end

def on_mount(:assign_current_user, _params, _session, _socket) do
end
```

When given only a module name, the first argument to `on_mount/4` will be the
atom `:default`.

#### LEEx templates in stateful LiveComponents

Stateful LiveComponents (where an `:id` is given) must now return HEEx templates
(`~H` sigil or `.heex` extension). LEEx templates (`~L` sigil or `.leex` extension)
are no longer supported. This addresses bugs and allows stateful components
to be rendered more efficiently client-side.

#### `phx-disconnected` class has been replaced with `phx-loading`

Due to a bug in the newly released Safari 15, the previously used `.phx-disconnected` class has been replaced by a new `.phx-loading` class. The reason for the change is `phx.new` included a `.phx-disconnected` rule in the generated `app.css` which triggers the Safari bug. Renaming the class avoids applying the erroneous rule for existing applications. Folks can upgrade by simply renaming their `.phx-disconnected` rules to `.phx-loading`.

#### `phx-capture-click` has been deprecated in favor of `phx-click-away`

The new `phx-click-away` binding replaces `phx-capture-click` and is much more versatile because it can detect "click focus" being lost on containers.

#### Removal of previously deprecated functionality

Some functionality that was previously deprecated has been removed:

  - Implicit assigns in `live_component` do-blocks is no longer supported
  - Passing a `@socket` to `live_component` will now raise if possible

### Enhancements
  - Allow slots in function components: they are marked as `<:slot_name>` and can be rendered with `<%= render_slot @slot_name %>`
  - Add `JS` command for executing JavaScript utility operations on the client with an extended push API
  - Optimize string attributes:
    - If the attribute is a string interpolation, such as `<div class={"foo bar #{@baz}"}>`, only the interpolation part is marked as dynamic
    - If the attribute can be empty, such as "class" and "style", keep the attribute name as static
  - Add a function component for rendering `Phoenix.LiveComponent`. Instead of `<%= live_component FormComponent, id: "form" %>`, you must now do: `<.live_component module={FormComponent} id="form" />`

### Bug fixes
  - Fix LiveViews with form recovery failing to properly mount following a reconnect when preceded by a live redirect
  - Fix stale session causing full redirect fallback when issuing a `push_redirect` from mount
  - Add workaround for Safari bug causing `<img>` tags with srcset and video with autoplay to fail to render
  - Support EEx interpolation inside HTML comments in HEEx templates
  - Support HTML tags inside script tags (as in regular HTML)
  - Raise if using quotes in attribute names
  - Include the filename in error messages when it is not possible to parse interpolated attributes
  - Make sure the test client always sends the full URL on `live_patch`/`live_redirect`. This mirrors the behaviour of the JavaScript client
  - Do not reload flash from session on `live_redirect`s
  - Fix select drop-down flashes in Chrome when the DOM is patched during focus

### Deprecations
  - `<%= live_component MyModule, id: @user.id, user: @user %>` is deprecated in favor of `<.live_component module={MyModule} id={@user.id} user={@user} />`. Notice the new API requires using HEEx templates. This change allows us to further improve LiveComponent and bring new features such as slots to them.
  - `render_block/2` in deprecated in favor of `render_slot/2`

## 0.16.4 (2021-09-22)

## 0.16.0 (2021-08-10)

### Security Considerations Upgrading from 0.15

LiveView v0.16 optimizes live redirects by supporting navigation purely
over the existing WebSocket connection. This is accomplished by the new
`live_session/3` feature of `Phoenix.LiveView.Router`. The
[security guide](/guides/server/security-model.md) has always stressed
the following:

> ... As we have seen, LiveView begins its life-cycle as a regular HTTP
> request. Then a stateful connection is established. Both the HTTP
> request and the stateful connection receives the client data via
> parameters and session. This means that any session validation must
> happen both in the HTTP request (plug pipeline) and the stateful
> connection (LiveView mount) ...

These guidelines continue to be valid, but it is now essential that the
stateful connection enforces authentication and session validation within
the LiveView mount lifecycle because **a `live_redirect` from the client
will not go through the plug pipeline** as a hard-refresh or initial HTTP
render would. This means authentication, authorization, etc that may be
done in the `Plug.Conn` pipeline must also be performed within the
LiveView mount lifecycle.

Live sessions allow you to support a shared security model by allowing
`live_redirect`s to only be issued between routes defined under the same
live session name. If a client attempts to live redirect to a different
live session, it will be refused and a graceful client-side redirect will
trigger a regular HTTP request to the attempted URL.

See the `Phoenix.LiveView.Router.live_session/3` docs for more information
and example usage.

### New HTML Engine

LiveView v0.16 introduces HEEx (HTML + EEx) templates and the concept of function
components via `Phoenix.Component`. The new HEEx templates validate the markup in
the template while also providing smarter change tracking as well as syntax
conveniences to make it easier to build composable components.

A function component is any function that receives a map of assigns and returns
a `~H` template:

```elixir
defmodule MyComponent do
  use Phoenix.Component

  def btn(assigns) do
    ~H"""
    <button class="btn"><%= @text %></button>
    """
  end
end
```

This component can now be used as in your HEEx templates as:

    <MyComponent.btn text="Save">

The introduction of HEEx and function components brings a series of deprecation
warnings, some introduced in this release and others which will be added in the
future. Note HEEx templates require Elixir v1.12+.

### Upgrading and deprecations

The main deprecation in this release is that the `~L` sigil and the `.leex` extension
are now soft-deprecated. The docs have been updated to discourage them and using them
will emit warnings in future releases. We recommend using the `~H` sigil and the `.heex`
extension for all future templates in your application. You should also plan to migrate
the old templates accordingly using the recommendations below.

Migrating from `LEEx` to `HEEx` is relatively straightforward. There are two main differences.
First of all, HEEx does not allow interpolation inside tags. So instead of:

```elixir
<div id="<%= @id %>">
  ...
</div>
```

One should use the HEEx syntax:

```elixir
<div id={@id}>
  ...
</div>
```

The other difference is in regards to `form_for`. Some templates may do the following:

```elixir
~L"""
<%= f = form_for @changeset, "#" %>
  <%= input f, :foo %>
</form>
"""
```

However, when converted to `~H`, it is not valid HTML: there is a `</form>` tag but
its opening is hidden inside the Elixir code. On LiveView v0.16, there is a function
component named `form`:

```elixir
~H"""
<.form :let={f} for={@changeset}>
  <%= input f, :foo %>
</.form>
"""
```

We understand migrating all templates from `~L` to `~H` can be a daunting task.
Therefore we plan to support `~L` in LiveViews for a long time. However, we can't
do the same for stateful LiveComponents, as some important client-side features and
optimizations will depend on the `~H` sigil. Therefore **our recommendation is to
replace `~L` by `~H` first in live components**, particularly stateful live components.

Furthermore, stateless `live_component` (i.e. live components without an `:id`)
will be deprecated in favor of the new function components. Our plan is to support
them for a reasonable period of time, but you should avoid creating new ones in
your application.

### Breaking Changes

LiveView 0.16 removes the `:layout` and `:container` options from
`Phoenix.LiveView.Routing.live/4` in favor of the `:root_layout`
and `:container` options on `Phoenix.Router.live_session/3`.

For instance, if you have the following in LiveView 0.15 and prior:

```elixir
live "/path", MyAppWeb.PageLive, layout: {MyAppWeb.LayoutView, "custom_layout.html"}
```

Change it to:

```elixir
live_session :session_name, root_layout: {MyAppWeb.LayoutView, "custom_layout.html"} do
  live "/path", MyAppWeb.PageLive
end
```

On the client, the `phoenix_live_view` package no longer provides a default export for `LiveSocket`.

If you have the following in your JavaScript entrypoint (typically located at `assets/js/app.js`):

```js
import LiveSocket from "phoenix_live_view"
```

Change it to:

```js
import { LiveSocket } from "phoenix_live_view"
```

Additionally on the client, the root LiveView element no longer exposes the
LiveView module name, therefore the `phx-view` attribute is never set.
Similarly, the `viewName` property of client hooks has been removed.

Codebases calling a custom function `component/3` should rename it or specify its module to avoid a conflict,
as LiveView introduces a macro with that name and it is special cased by the underlying engine.

  - Optimize components to share static values
  - [LiveViewTest] Automatically synchronize before render events

## 0.13.0 (2020-05-21)

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - No longer send event metadata by default. Metadata is now opt-in and user defined at the `LiveSocket` level.
  To maintain backwards compatibility with pre-0.13 behaviour, you can provide the following metadata option:

  ```
  let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {
    params: {_csrf_token: csrfToken},
    metadata: {
      click: (e, el) => {
        return {
          altKey: e.altKey,
          shiftKey: e.shiftKey,
          ctrlKey: e.ctrlKey,
          metaKey: e.metaKey,
          x: e.x || e.clientX,
          y: e.y || e.clientY,
          pageX: e.pageX,
          pageY: e.pageY,
          screenX: e.screenX,
          screenY: e.screenY,
          offsetX: e.offsetX,
          offsetY: e.offsetY,
          detail: e.detail || 1,
        }
      },
      keydown: (e, el) => {
        return {
          altGraphKey: e.altGraphKey,
          altKey: e.altKey,
          code: e.code,
          ctrlKey: e.ctrlKey,
          key: e.key,
          keyIdentifier: e.keyIdentifier,
          keyLocation: e.keyLocation,
          location: e.location,
          metaKey: e.metaKey,
          repeat: e.repeat,
          shiftKey: e.shiftKey
        }
      }
    }
  })
  ```

### Bug fixes
  - Fix error caused by Chrome sending a keydown event on native UI autocomplete without a `key`
  - Fix server error when a live navigation request issues a redirect
  - Fix double window bindings when explicit calls to LiveSocket connect/disconnect/connect

### Enhancements
  - Add `Phoenix.LiveView.get_connect_info/1`
  - Add `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.put_connect_info/2` and `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.put_connect_params/2`
  - Add support for tracking static asset changes on the page across cold server deploys
  - Add support for passing a `@myself` target to a hook's `pushEventTo` target
  - Add configurable metadata for events with new `metadata` LiveSocket option
  - Add `"_mounts"` key in connect params which specifies the number of times a LiveView has mounted

## 0.12.1 (2020-04-19)

### Bug fixes
  - Fix component `innerHTML` being discarded when a sibling DOM element appears above it, in cases where the component lacks a DOM ID
  - Fix Firefox reconnecting briefly during hard redirects
  - Fix `phx-disable-with` and other pending attributes failing to be restored when an empty patch is returned by server
  - Ensure LiveView module is loaded before mount to prevent first application request logging errors if the very first request is to a connected LiveView

## 0.12.0 (2020-04-16)

This version of LiveView comes with an overhaul of the testing module, more closely integrating your LiveView template with your LiveView events. For example, in previous versions, you could write this test:

  ```elixir
  render_click(live_view, "increment_by", %{by: 1})
  ```

However, there is no guarantee that there is any element on the page with a `phx-click="increment"` attribute and `phx-value-by` set to 1. With LiveView 0.12.0, you can now write:

  ```elixir
  live_view
  |> element("#term .buttons a", "Increment")
  |> render_click()
  ```

The new implementation will check there is a button at `#term .buttons a`, with "Increment" as text, validate that it has a `phx-click` attribute and automatically submit to it with all relevant `phx-value` entries. This brings us closer to integration/acceptance test frameworks without any of the overhead and complexities of running a headless browser.

### Enhancements
  - Add `assert_patch/3` and `assert_patched/2` for asserting on patches
  - Add `follow_redirect/3` to automatically follow redirects from `render_*` events
  - Add `phx-trigger-action` form annotation to trigger an HTTP form submit on next DOM patch

### Bug fixes
  - Fix `phx-target` `@myself` targeting a sibling LiveView component with the same component ID
  - Fix `phx:page-loading-stop` firing before the DOM patch has been performed
  - Fix `phx-update="prepend"` failing to properly patch the DOM when the same ID is updated back to back
  - Fix redirects on mount failing to copy flash

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - `phx-error-for` has been removed in favor of `phx-feedback-for`. `phx-feedback-for` will set a `phx-no-feedback` class whenever feedback has to be hidden
  - `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.children/1` has been renamed to `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.live_children/1`
  - `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.find_child/2` has been renamed to `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.find_live_child/2`
  - `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.assert_redirect/3` no longer matches on the flash, instead it returns the flash
  - `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.assert_redirect/3` no longer matches on the patch redirects, use `assert_patch/3` instead
  - `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.assert_remove/3` has been removed. If the LiveView crashes, it will cause the test to crash too
  - Passing a path with DOM IDs to `render_*` test functions is deprecated. Furthermore, they now require a `phx-target="<%= @id %>"` on the given DOM ID:

    ```heex
    <div id="component-id" phx-target="component-id">
      ...
    </div>
    ```

    ```elixir
    html = render_submit([view, "#component-id"], event, value)
    ```

    In any case, this API is deprecated and you should migrate to the new element based API.

## 0.11.1 (2020-04-08)

### Bug fixes
  - Fix readonly states failing to be undone after an empty diff
  - Fix dynamically added child failing to be joined by the client
  - Fix teardown bug causing stale client sessions to attempt a rejoin on reconnect
  - Fix orphaned prepend/append content across joins
  - Track `unless` in LiveEEx engine

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - `render_event`/`render_click` and friends now expect a DOM ID selector to be given when working with components. For example, instead of `render_click([live, "user-13"])`, you should write `render_click([live, "#user-13"])`, mirroring the `phx-target` API.
  - Accessing the socket assigns directly `@socket.assigns[...]` in a template will now raise the exception `Phoenix.LiveView.Socket.AssignsNotInSocket`. The socket assigns are available directly inside the template as LiveEEx `assigns`, such as `@foo` and `@bar`. Any assign access should be done using the assigns in the template where proper change tracking takes place.

### Enhancements
  - Trigger debounced events immediately on input blur
  - Support `defaults` option on `LiveSocket` constructor to configure default `phx-debounce` and `phx-throttle` values, allowing `<input ... phx-debounce>`
  - Add `detail` key to click event metadata for detecting double/triple clicks

## 0.11.0 (2020-04-06)

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - Remove `socket.assigns` during render to avoid change tracking bugs. If you were previously relying on passing `@socket` to functions then referencing socket assigns, pass the explicit assign instead to your functions from the template.
  - Removed `assets/css/live_view.css`. If you want to show a progress bar then in `app.css`, replace


    ```diff
    - @import "../../../../deps/phoenix_live_view/assets/css/live_view.css";
    + @import "../node_modules/nprogress/nprogress.css";
    ```

    and add `nprogress` to `assets/package.json`. Full details in the [Progress animation guide](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.11.0/installation.html#progress-animation)

### Bug fixes
  - Fix client issue with greater than two levels of LiveView nesting
  - Fix bug causing entire LiveView to be re-rendering with only a component changed
  - Fix issue where rejoins would not trigger `phx:page-loading-stop`

### Enhancements
  - Support deep change tracking so `@foo.bar` only executes and diffs when bar changes
  - Add `@myself` assign, to allow components to target themselves instead of relying on a DOM ID, for example: `phx-target="<%= @myself %>"`
  - Optimize various client rendering scenarios for faster DOM patching
  of components and append/prepended content
  - Add `enableProfiling()` and `disableProfiling()` to `LiveSocket` for client performance profiling to aid the development process
  - Allow LiveViews to be rendered inside LiveComponents
  - Add support for clearing flash inside components

## 0.10.0 (2020-03-18)

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - Rename socket assign `@live_view_module` to `@live_module`
  - Rename socket assign `@live_view_action` to `@live_action`
  - LiveView no longer uses the default app layout and `put_live_layout` is no longer supported. Instead, use `put_root_layout`. Note, however, that the layout given to `put_root_layout` must use `@inner_content` instead of `<%= render(@view_module, @view_template, assigns) %>` and that the root layout will also be used by regular views. Check the [Live Layouts](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/0.10.0/Phoenix.LiveView.html#module-live-layouts) section of the docs.

### Bug fixes
  - Fix loading states causing nested LiveViews to be removed during live navigation
  - Only trigger `phx-update="ignore"` hook if data attributes have changed
  - Fix LiveEEx fingerprint bug causing no diff to be sent in certain cases

### Enhancements
  - Support collocated templates where an `.html.leex` template of the same basename of the LiveView will be automatically used for `render/1`
  - Add `live_title_tag/2` helper for automatic prefix/suffix on `@page_title` updates

## 0.9.0 (2020-03-08)

### Bug fixes
  - Do not set ignored inputs and buttons as readonly
  - Only decode paths in URIs
  - Only destroy main descendents when replacing main
  - Fix sibling component patches when siblings at same root DOM tree
  - Do not pick the layout from `:use` on child LiveViews
  - Respect when the layout is set to `false` in the router and on mount
  - Fix sibling component patch when component siblings lack a container
  - Make flash optional (i.e. LiveView will still work if you don't `fetch_flash` before)

### Enhancements
  - Raise if `:flash` is given as an assign
  - Support user-defined metadata in router
  - Allow the router to be accessed as `socket.router`
  - Allow `MFArgs` as the `:session` option in the `live` router macro
  - Trigger page loading event when main LV errors
  - Automatically clear the flash on live navigation examples - only the newly assigned flash is persisted

## 0.8.1 (2020-02-27)

## 0.8.0 (2020-02-22)

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - Remove `Phoenix.LiveView.Flash` in favor of `:fetch_live_flash` imported by `Phoenix.LiveView.Router`
  - Live layout must now access the child contents with `@inner_content` instead of invoking the LiveView directly
  - Returning `:stop` tuples from LiveView `mount` or `handle_[params|call|cast|info|event]` is no longer supported. LiveViews are stopped when issuing a `redirect` or `push_redirect`

### Enhancements
  - Add `put_live_layout` plug to put the root layout used for live routes
  - Allow `redirect` and `push_redirect` from mount
  - Use acknowledgement tracking to avoid patching inputs until the server has processed the form event
  - Add CSS loading states to all phx bound elements with event specific CSS classes
  - Dispatch `phx:page-loading-start` and `phx:page-loading-stop` on window for live navigation, initial page loads, and form submits, for user controlled page loading integration
  - Allow any phx bound element to specify `phx-page-loading` to dispatch loading events above when the event is pushed
  - Add client side latency simulator with new `enableLatencySim(milliseconds)` and `disableLatencySim()`
  - Add `enableDebug()` and `disableDebug()` to `LiveSocket` for ondemand browser debugging from the web console
  - Do not connect LiveSocket WebSocket or bind client events unless a LiveView is found on the page
  - Add `transport_pid/1` to return the websocket transport pid when the socket is connected

### Bug Fixes

  - Fix checkbox bug failing to maintain checked state when a checkbox is programmatically updated by the server
  - Fix select bug in Firefox causing the highlighted index to jump when a patch is applied during hover state

## 0.7.0 (2020-02-12)

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - `live_redirect` was removed in favor of `push_patch` (for updating the URL and params of the current LiveView) and `push_redirect` (for updating the URL to another LiveView)
  - `live_link` was removed in favor of  `live_patch` (for updating the URL and params of the current LiveView) and `live_redirect` (for updating the URL to another LiveView)
  - `Phoenix.LiveViewTest.assert_redirect` no longer accepts an anonymous function in favor of executing the code
  prior to asserting the redirects, just like `assert_receive`.

### Enhancements
  - Support `@live_view_action` in LiveViews to simplify tracking of URL state
  - Recovery form input data automatically on disconnects or crash recovery
  - Add `phx-auto-recover` form binding for specialized recovery
  - Scroll to top of page while respecting anchor hash targets on `live_patch` and `live_redirect`

## 0.6.0 (2020-01-22)

### Deprecations
  - LiveView `mount/2` has been deprecated in favor of `mount/3`. The params are now passed as the first argument to `mount/3`, followed by the session and socket.

### Backwards incompatible changes

### Enhancements
  - Allow window beforeunload to be cancelled without losing websocket connection

### Bug Fixes
  - Fix handle_params not decoding URL path parameters properly
  - Fix LiveViewTest error when routing at root path

### Bug Fixes
  - Fix phx-change bug causing phx-target to not be used

## 0.5.0 (2020-01-15)

LiveView now makes the connection session automatically available in LiveViews. However, to do so, you need to configure your endpoint accordingly, **otherwise LiveView will fail to connect**.

The steps are:

  1) Find `plug Plug.Session, ...` in your endpoint.ex and move the options `...` to a module attribute:

      ```elixir
      @session_options [
        ...
      ]
      ```

  2) Change the `plug Plug.Session` to use said attribute:

      ```elixir
      plug Plug.Session, @session_options
      ```

  3) Also pass the `@session_options` to your LiveView socket:

      ```elixir
      socket "/live", Phoenix.LiveView.Socket,
        websocket: [connect_info: [session: @session_options]]
      ```

  4) You should define the CSRF meta tag inside <head> in your layout, before `app.js` is included:

      ```heex
      <meta name="csrf-token" content={Plug.CSRFProtection.get_csrf_token()} />
      <script type="text/javascript" src="<%= Routes.static_path(@conn, "/js/app.js") %>"></script>
      ```

  5) Then in your app.js:

      ```
      let csrfToken = document.querySelector("meta[name='csrf-token']").getAttribute("content");
      let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {params: {_csrf_token: csrfToken}});
      ```

Also note that **the session from now on will have string keys**. LiveView will warn if atom keys are used.

### Enhancements
  - Respect new tab behavior in `live_link`
  - Add `beforeUpdate` and `beforeDestroy` JS hooks
  - Make all assigns defined on the socket mount available on the layout on first render
  - Provide support for live layouts with new `:layout` option
  - Detect duplicate IDs on the front-end when DEBUG mode is enabled
  - Automatically forward the session to LiveView
  - Support "live_socket_id" session key for identifying (and disconnecting) LiveView sockets
  - Add support for `hibernate_after` on LiveView processes
  - Support redirecting to full URLs on `live_redirect` and `redirect`
  - Add `offsetX` and `offsetY` to click event metadata
  - Allow `live_link` and `live_redirect` to exist anywhere in the page and it will always target the main LiveView (the one defined at the router)

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - `phx-target="window"` has been removed in favor of `phx-window-keydown`, `phx-window-focus`, etc, and the `phx-target` binding has been repurposed for targeting LiveView and LiveComponent events from the client
  - `Phoenix.LiveView` no longer defined `live_render` and `live_link`. These functions have been moved to `Phoenix.LiveView.Helpers` which can now be fully imported in your views. In other words, replace `import Phoenix.LiveView, only: [live_render: ..., live_link: ...]` by `import Phoenix.LiveView.Helpers`

## 0.4.1 (2019-11-07)

### Enhancements
  - [LiveView] Add new `:container` option to `use Phoenix.LiveView`
  - [LiveViewTest] Add `live_isolated` test helper for testing LiveViews which are not routable

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - Replace `configure_temporary_assigns/2` with 3-tuple mount return, supporting a `:temporary_assigns` key
  - Do not allow `redirect`/`live_redirect` on mount nor in child live views
  - All `phx-update` containers now require a unique ID
  - `LiveSocket` JavaScript constructor now requires explicit dependency injection of Phoenix Socket constructor. For example:

  - Fix blur event metadata being sent with type of `"focus"`

## 0.1.2 (2019-08-28)

### Backwards incompatible changes
  - `phx-value` has no effect, use `phx-value-*` instead
  - The `:path_params` key in session has no effect (use `handle_params` in LiveView instead)

## 0.1.1 (2019-08-27)

### Enhancements
  - Use optimized `insertAdjacentHTML` for faster append/prepend and proper CSS animation handling
  - Allow for replacing previously appended/prepended elements by replacing duplicate IDs during append/prepend instead of adding new DOM nodes

### Bug Fixes
  - Fix duplicate append/prepend updates when parent content is updated
  - Fix JS hooks not being applied for appending and prepended content

## 0.1.0 (2019-08-25)

### Enhancements
  - The LiveView `handle_in/3` callback now receives a map of metadata about the client event
  - For `phx-change` events, `handle_in/3` now receives a `"_target"` param representing the keyspace of the form input name which triggered the change
  - Multiple values may be provided for any phx binding by using the `phx-value-` prefix, such as `phx-value-myval1`, `phx-value-myval2`, etc
  - Add control over the DOM patching via `phx-update`, which can be set to `"replace"`, `"append"`, `"prepend"` or `"ignore"`

### Backwards incompatible changes
